### Data structures, as the term implies, are a way of structuring data in order to efficiently store, find, use, and create data, depending on the task at hand.
If data is a plate of food, data structures are your utensils (algorithms would be how to effectively use those utensils in this analogy).

## Terms

### Data Definition
Defines a particular data withe the following characteristics.
- Atomic \- Definition should  define a single concept.
- Traceable \- Definition should be able to be mapped to some data element.
- Accurate \- Definition should be unambiguos.
- Clear and Concise \- Definition should be understandable.

### Data Object
Represents tan object having data.

### Data Type
Data type is a way to classify various types of data such as integer, string, etc. which determines the values that can be used with the corresponding type of data,
the type of operations that can be performed on the corresponding type of data. There are two data types −

- Built-in Data Type
- Derived Data Type
### Built-in Data Type
 Those data types for which a language has built-in support are known as Built-in Data types. For example, most of the languages provide the following built-in data types.

- Integers
- Boolean (true, false)
- Floating (Decimal numbers)
- Character and Strings

### Derived Data Type
Those data types which are implementation independent as they can be implemented in one or the other way are known as derived data types.
These data types are normally built by the combination of primary or built-in data types and associated operations on them. For example −

- List
- Array
- Stack
- Queue

### Basic Operations
The data in the data structures are processed by certain operations.
The particular data structure chosen largely depends on the frequency of the operation that needs to be performed on the data structure.

- Traversing
- Searching
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Sorting
- Merging
